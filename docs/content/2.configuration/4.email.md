## Email

The API for sending emails depends on the provider used. Currently only `custom` and `sendgrid` are supported. The configuration can be set with `email` config option.

::alert{type="warning"}
Note that only HTML messages are supported.

#### Custom

Custom provider is an HTTP `POST` request to a custom endpoint. If its handler is internal, it will be a function call.

```ts
// The configuration
interface MailCustomProvider {
  name: "custom";
  url: string;
  authorization: string;
}

// The request body
interface Body = {
  to: string;
  from: string;
  subject: string;
  html: string;
};
```

#### Sendgrid

To send emails with [Sendgrid](https://sendgrid.com), an API key is required.

```ts
interface MailSendgridProvider {
  name: "sendgrid";
  apiKey: string;
}
```

#### Customization

A default templates are provided for email verification and password reset. To customize them, `email.templates` config option is provided. Exposed variables are **User**, **link** for redirection and **validityInMinutes** (equals to accessToken maxAge). 

It's recommended to use [maily.to](https://maily.to/) to build well designed templates.

```js
templates: {
    passwordReset:
    `<html lang="en">
     <body>
       <h2>Hello {{name}},</h2>
       <p>To reset your password, please follow this link</p>
       <a href="{{link}}">Reset your password</a>
       <p>Valid for {{validityInMinutes}} minutes</p>
     </body>
    </html>`,
}
```
