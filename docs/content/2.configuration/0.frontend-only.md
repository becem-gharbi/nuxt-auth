## Frontend-only

The module has a built-in Backend for handling authentication and serving resources with authorization. It's built on top of Prisma ORM. 

For more flexibility, the module provides a Frontend-only option that turns off the built-in Backend by excluding the server's handlers, utilities and middlewares and permits developers to bring their own. The provided Backend can be internal, meaning as part of the application, or external. 

This feature does not effect the Frontend implementation meaning same APIs and benefits (auto-redirection, token storage..) as the Full-stack implementation.

The specification for the Backend APIs is provided [here](https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis-docs/becem-gharbi/nuxt-auth).

To enable this feature, these config options should be set: 
- `backendEnabled` set to `false`. 
- `backendBaseUrl` set to `/` for internal Backend.
