# Tokens

Tokens play a crucial role in the authentication process within this module. They serve as secure identifiers that grant access to protected resources and enable seamless user experiences across sessions.

**It is important to note:**

::list{type="primary"}

- The module utilizes JWT-based authorization for secure authentication.
- Within the module, the term **`session`** specifically denotes the Refresh token.
- The APIs responsible for signing and verifying tokens are optimized for edge compatibility, courtesy of the [Jose](https://github.com/panva/jose) package

## Configuration

::list{type="primary"}

- The module employs the [`HS256`](https://www.loginradius.com/blog/engineering/jwt-signing-algorithms/#hs256) algorithm, utilizing symmetric encryption for enhanced security.
- You have the flexibility to customize encryption options through the `auth` configuration in your `nuxt.config` file.

::

```ts
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  // ...
  auth: {
    accessToken: {
      jwtSecret: "", // Required
      maxAge: 15 * 60, // The access token is valid for 15 minutes
    },
    refreshToken: {
      jwtSecret: "", // Required
      maxAge: 7 * 24 * 60 * 60, // The refresh token is valid for 7 days
      cookieName: "auth_refresh_token",
    },
  },
  // ...
});
```

### **Recommendation**

While you can set the values above directly in the `nuxt.config` file, it is advisable to store sensitive information such as `jwtSecret` in environment variables. This practice ensures that your secrets remain secure and are not exposed to the public. It also allows you to easily manage different configurations across different environments.

> You can use the command below to generate a secure secret for your JWT tokens.

```bash
node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(64).toString('hex'))"
```

::code-group

```bash [.env]
JWT_SECRET=your_secret
MAX_AGE=900 # 15 minutes
REFRESH_SECRET=your_secret
REFRESH_MAX_AGE=604800 # 7 days
COOKIE_NAME=auth_refresh_token

```

```ts [nuxt.config]
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  // ...
  auth: {
    accessToken: {
      jwtSecret: process.env.JWT_SECRET,
      maxAge: Number(process.env.MAX_AGE),
    },
    refreshToken: {
      jwtSecret: process.env.REFRESH_SECRET,
      maxAge: Number(process.env.REFRESH_MAX_AGE),
      cookieName: process.env.COOKIE_NAME,
    },
  },
  // ...
});
```

## Custom claims

Some backend services require JWT claims for authorization such as [Hasura](https://hasura.io). In order to add dynamic custom claims to the access token's payload, `accessToken.customClaims` is provided. For injecting **User** related fields, use the [mustache](https://github.com/janl/mustache.js) syntax.

```js
customClaims: {
  "https://hasura.io/jwt/claims": {
    "x-hasura-allowed-roles": ["user", "admin"],
    "x-hasura-default-role": "{{role}}",
    "x-hasura-user-id": "{{id}}",
  },
},
```

## Purge sessions

The sessions are subject to expiration in case the user does not refresh his login. To flush this useless data and improve database query time, the module exposes the following REST API that can be called with a cron-job for example. Note that `webhookKey` config option is required in this case.

```bash
curl -X DELETE -H "Webhook-Key: {webhookKey}" {baseUrl}/api/auth/session/revoke/expired
```
