## Tokens

The module implements a JWT based authorization. The term `session` used refers to the Refresh token.

The APIs for singning and verifying tokens are edge compatible thanks to [Jose](https://github.com/panva/jose) package.

#### Options

The algorithm used is `HS256` with symetric encryption, options can be set via `auth` config option.

```js
accessToken: {
    jwtSecret: "", // Required
    maxAge: 15 * 60, // The access token is valid for 15 minutes
},

refreshToken: {
    jwtSecret: "", // Required
    maxAge: 7 * 24 * 60 * 60, // The refresh token is valid for 7 days
    cookieName: "auth_refresh_token",
}
```

#### Custom claims

Some backend services require JWT claims for authorization such as [Hasura](https://hasura.io). In order to add dynamic custom claims to the access token's payload, `accessToken.customClaims` is provided. For injecting **User** related fields, use the [mustache](https://github.com/janl/mustache.js) syntax.

```js
customClaims: {
  "https://hasura.io/jwt/claims": {
    "x-hasura-allowed-roles": ["user", "admin"],
    "x-hasura-default-role": "{{role}}",
    "x-hasura-user-id": "{{id}}",
  },
},
```

#### Purge sessions

The sessions are subject to expiration in case the user does not refresh his login. To flush this useless data and improve database query time, the module exposes the following REST API that can be called with a cron-job for example. Note that `webhookKey` config option is required in this case.

```bash
curl -X DELETE -H "Webhook-Key: {webhookKey}" {baseUrl}/api/auth/session/revoke/expired
```
