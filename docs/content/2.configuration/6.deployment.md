# Deployment

The module supports deployment to node servers and edge workers with support for these tested environments `cloudflare` `cloudlare-pages` `netlify-edge` `vercel-edge`. Please open a PR for others.

## NodeJS

No special configuration is needed, just make sure to execute `npx prisma generate` on the build step.

## Edge workers

Thanks to [Accelerate](https://www.prisma.io/docs/data-platform/accelerate/what-is-accelerate) it's possible to query the database on edge environments. It's recommended to read this [article](https://www.prisma.io/blog/database-access-on-the-edge-8F0t1s1BqOJE).

It's required to explicitly set `nitro.preset` option in order for the module to import Prisma edge client instead of the Node client.

```ts [nuxt.config.ts]
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  // ...
  nitro: {
    preset: process.env.NITRO_PRESET,
  },
  // ...
});
```

On production build, make sure to execute `npx prisma generate --no-engine` on the build step. Also to use the proxied database URL `prisma://` instead of the direct URL.

In case of Cloudflare, it's required to set `prisma.datasourceUrl` in order to pass the `DATABASE_URL` env at runtime.

```ts [nuxt.config.ts]
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  // ...
  auth: {
    prisma: {
      datasourceUrl: process.env.DATABASE_URL,
    },
  },
  // ...
});
```
