## Introduction

Nuxt auth is an unofficial module for [Nuxt3](https://nuxt.com) that aims to provide a complete solution for authentication.

- Complete, as no external authentication service is required. It provides registration and login with email/password or directly via oauth2 providers.

- Database agnostic, it works with any SQL database or even Mongo DB as it uses [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io) ORM as Model layer.

- Lightweight, the server handlers and session storage are implemented with Nuxt's native APIs for minimal bundle size.

- Edge compatible, thanks to [UnJS](https://unjs.io) partically the work on [Nitro](https://github.com/unjs/nitro) the module can run on edge environments.

- Email customization, it provides the needed flows for email verification and password reset with customizable email templates.

- Ready to use [starter](https://nuxt-starter.bg.tn).
