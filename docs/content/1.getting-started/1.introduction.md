# Introduction

Nuxt auth is an unofficial module for [Nuxt](https://nuxt.com) that aims to provide a complete solution for authentication.

- Complete, as no external authentication service is required. It provides registration and login with email/password or directly via oauth2 providers.

- Database agnostic, it works with any SQL database or even Mongo DB as it uses [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io) ORM as Model layer.

- Frontend only option by replacing the built-in Backend with a custom one (internally or externally).

- Edge compatible, thanks to [UnJS](https://unjs.io) partically the work on [Nitro](https://github.com/unjs/nitro) the module can run on edge environments.

- Email customization, it provides the needed flows for email verification and password reset with customizable email templates.

- Ready to use starters [nuxt-starter](https://github.com/becem-gharbi/nuxt-starter), [prisma-cloudflare](https://github.com/becem-gharbi/prisma-cloudflare).
