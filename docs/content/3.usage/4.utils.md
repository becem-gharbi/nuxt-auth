## Utils

Some internal utilities are exposed by the module and therefore can be used.

#### Server-side

Server utilites are exposed via `#auth` module.

- `sendEmail` to send email messages.
- `handleError` to create and throw H3 error or redirect with `error` passed as query parameter.
- `hashSync` and `compareSync` to hash and verify strings via [bcryptjs](https://github.com/dcodeIO/bcrypt.js) package.
- `encode` and `decode` to sign and verify JWT via [jose](https://github.com/panva/jose) package.
