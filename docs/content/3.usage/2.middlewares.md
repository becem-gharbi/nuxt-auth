## Middlewares

The client-side and server-side middlewares needed for redirection and authorization are built-in.

#### Client-side

The module provides two approaches for page redirection. They can be combined.

- Globally enable by setting `enableGlobalAuthMiddleware` config option to `true` and locally disable via `auth` page meta.

```js
definePageMeta({
  auth: false,
});
```

- Locally enable using `auth` & `guest` middlewares.

```js
definePageMeta({ middleware: "auth" }); // Redirects to login route when not loggedIn

definePageMeta({ middleware: "guest" }); // Redirects to home route when loggedIn
```

#### Server-side

The access token's payload is provided for authorization via `event.context.auth` property. So it can be checked to reject unauthorized calls.

Another thing provided is Prisma client it can be accessed via `event.context.prisma`.
