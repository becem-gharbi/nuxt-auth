# Hooks

To enhance the functionality of the module, custom hooks have been implemented.

## `auth:loggedIn`

This hook triggers on login and logout events, providing the opportunity to incorporate asynchronous logic before executing redirection.

The `loggedIn` parameter is a boolean value that indicates the user's authentication status.

```ts
export default defineNuxtPlugin({
  enforce: "pre", // Should be registered before built-in plugin
  hooks: {
    "auth:loggedIn": async (loggedIn) => {},
  },
});
```

Feel free to utilize this hook to customize the behavior of the authentication process according to your project's requirements.
